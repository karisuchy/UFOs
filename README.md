# UFOs

## Overview

For this project, I created a table to organize UFO data.
built dynamic/interactive web page that accepts user inputs and displays results accordingly.this was accomplished by using the following resources:

- Stored data in JavaScript array, then built a table on this array.
- Created a storyboard that served as a blueprint for the website layout.
- Used JavaScript to build the website components.
- Created functions that allow readers to filter data by using JavaScripts D3 library and HTML language.
- Customized the webpage by using HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS.

## Resources

- Data Sources: NEED TO ADD SOURCE FOR data.js FILE!!!
- Software: JavaScript, HTML, VS Studio Code 1.62.3, CSS, Bootstrap

## Results

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)

The image below shows the full website:

Users can narrow down the list by selecting a specific date, city, state, country, or shape. The screen below only displays sightings on January 13, 2010.

Users can also filter by multiple criteria at once such as the example below which only displays sightings in California in the form of a light.
