# UFOs

## Overview

For this project, I created a dynamic website that organizes UFO sightings, accepts user input, and displays results accordingly. This was accomplished by using the following resources:

- Stored data in JavaScript array, then built a table on this array.
- Created a storyboard that served as a blueprint for the website layout.
- Used JavaScript to build the website components.
- Created functions that allow readers to filter data by using JavaScripts D3 library and HTML language.
- Customized the webpage by using HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS.

## Resources

- Data Sources: data.js 
- Software: JavaScript, HTML, VS Studio Code 1.62.3, CSS, Bootstrap

## Results

The image below shows the full website:

Users can narrow the list by selecting a specific date, city, state, country, and shape. The screen below only displays sightings on January 13, 2010.

Users can also filter by multiple criteria at once as demonstrated in the example below which only displays sightings in California in the form of a light.

## Summary

The current dataset currently contains only a small amount of data from 2010; the website would be much more useful for users with a larger dataset.  

Once the dataset has been expanded, I recommend additional website enhancements such as a search by keyword in the comment field and the ability to sort the list by clicking on column headers.
